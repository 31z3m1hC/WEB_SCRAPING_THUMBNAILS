# Text and Document Processing

## Overview:

This project involves leveraging advanced technologies and tools to generate textual content, process associated images, and generate Word documents. The comprehensive process includes text generation using Gemini AI, document formatting in Microsoft PowerPoint and Word, and Thumbnails Extraction from Windows thumbcache databases.

## Processes:

### 1. Text Generation using Gemini AI:

- Utilized the Gemini AI text-based model to generate diverse sets of essays.
- Structured output in JSON format, employing a prompt-based approach for title page creation.
- Each set includes the title, author's name, affiliation, and email, resulting in 1000 unique text sets.

### 2. Document Formatting in Microsoft PowerPoint and Word:

- Transferred 1000 generated text sets into Microsoft PowerPoint and Word documents.
- Diversified presentation by saving each PowerPoint set in three font types, resulting in a total of 3000 PowerPoint slides.
- Accompanied each PowerPoint and Word file with a corresponding .txt copy of the text for reference and analysis.

### 3. Thumbnails Extraction using Thumbcache Viewer:

- Employed Thumbcache Viewer on a Windows 10 machine to extract thumbnails from thumbcache_xxx.db files.
- Extracted thumbnails in three resolutions: 256 (Extra-large), 96 (Large), and 48 (Medium), based on folder explorer display preferences.
- Successfully acquired high-quality image representations of the document content.

### 4. Python Script for Mapping Thumbnails and Creating Raw Image Counterparts:

- Developed a Python script to map extracted thumbnails to their original PowerPoint and Word files.
- Ensured seamless integration between textual and visual elements for comprehensive data analysis.
- Created raw image counterparts of PowerPoint and Word files, enhancing the dataset for future training purposes.

## Technical Environment:

- Gemini AI for text generation.
- Microsoft PowerPoint and Word for document formatting.
- Thumbcache Viewer on Windows 10 for thumbnails extraction.
- Python for scripting and mapping functionalities.

## Future Considerations:

- Continuous refinement of text generation models for enhanced content diversity.
- Exploration of advanced image processing techniques to improve dataset quality.
- Integration of emerging technologies to further optimize the overall workflow.

This readme file provides an overview of the comprehensive processes involved in text generation, document creation, and thumbnails extraction. The combination of cutting-edge tools and thoughtful scripting ensures the creation of a rich dataset suitable for various applications, from content generation to training machine learning models.
